# Heather Moore Data Science Portfolio

  Hello! My name is Heather Moore and this is my professional portfolio. I graduated with Bachelors degree in economics with a minor in data science at Iowa State University. Currently I am finishing my Masters (MS) in Data Science. During my academic career I gained proficiency in the programming languages Python, R, and SQL. 

  Currently, I hold a civilian service position, Operations Research Analyst,for the Air Force. At the Studies and Analysis Squadron, my team and I gather data across the Air Education and Training Command to conduct analyze as well as create products for our customers. Our job is to create accurate yet useful analytics to aid non-technical customers in automating daily tasks  and making data-driven decision. This role helped me improve my coding in all of my known languages as well help me gain experience in creating dashboards through Power BI and Envision by Palantir. 

  With my studies and work experience, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets moving forward in my career.
